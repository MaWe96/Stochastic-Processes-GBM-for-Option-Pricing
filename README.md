This project explores stochastic process in financial markets by simulating stock price movements with geometric Brownian motion using MATLAB and pricing European and Asian options using the Black-Scholes model.

Key features:
- Customizable drift and volatility parameters.
- Computing expected payoff, option premiums and analyzing convergence to the Black-Scholes theoretical price.
- Evaluates Asian exotic options.
- Visual and numerical analysis.

Key results:
- GBM simulated stock prices follow an exponential trajectory, yielding lognormally distributed results.
- BM paths are normally distributed with drift zero.
- Monte Carlo estimates converge to Black Scholes prices with increasing simulations.
